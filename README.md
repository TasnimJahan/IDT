## Applied supervised and semi-supervised model for Parkinson's disease detection.
My research focuses on identifyng the presence of Parkinson's disease by using supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques. I used XGBoost and Random Forest for supervised learning and explored FixMatch and GAN models for semi-supervised learning. Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipayanbiswas/parkinsons-disease-speech-signal-features.]

### For supervsed::
I have tried several supervised learning model here. and got highest accuracy in XGBoost. XGBoost Accuracy:got 0.90. Then applied ensamble XGBoost and SVM model in supervised model.

In another model. I got:
- Random Forest :
  - Random Forest Accuracy: 0.88(got this)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) :
  - SVM Accuracy: 0.86(got this)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier :
  - Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 0.85(got this)
- XGBoost :
  - XGBoost Accuracy: 0.90(got this and applied)
- Logistic Regression :
  - Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.87(got this)

### For Semi-supervsed::
Then used GAN in semi supervised model.
